# BeyondSight

Beyond Sight is an AI-powered assistive application designed to help vision-impaired individuals to navigate their surroundings with ease and also to know who is coming towards them with the help of facial recognition using their saved contact database. The application provides real-time voice-guided navigation, object detection, facial recognition, and auditory assistance to improve accessibility and independence.

🚀 Features

Voice-Guided Navigation: Provides step-by-step audio guidance to help users move safely.

Object Detection: Identifies objects in the environment and describes them audibly.
