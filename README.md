# BeyondSight

Beyond Sight is an AI-powered assistive application designed to help vision-impaired individuals to navigate their surroundings with ease and also to know who is coming towards them with the help of facial recognition using their saved contact database. The application provides real-time voice-guided navigation, object detection, facial recognition, and auditory assistance to improve accessibility and independence.

üöÄ Features

Voice-Guided Navigation: Provides step-by-step audio guidance to help users move safely.

Object Detection: Identifies objects in the environment and describes them audibly.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Python (OpenCV, Face Recognition, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas)

Text-to-Speech (TTS) via ElevenLabs API

Computer Vision for facial and object recognition

Machine Learning for facial detection

CSV Database for storing recognized faces

üîß Installation

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/KrishnaLodha/BeyondSight.git
cd BeyondSight

2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up ElevenLabs API

Sign up at ElevenLabs

Get your API key.

Open speech.py and replace your_api_key_here with your actual key.


üìå How It Works

The camera detects faces and objects in real-time.

If a face is recognized, the system speaks the person's name.

Objects in the surroundings are identified and described audibly.

The system provides navigation assistance using voice commands.

‚ö° Future Enhancements

Multi-Language Support: Enable support for multiple languages in TTS.

Gesture Recognition: Allow users to give commands via hand gestures.

Cloud Integration: Store user profiles and history for personalized assistance.
